This project has been build by using all the principles of OOPs. User can calculate the value of any infix expression. This project is can be extended very easily. Currently this project supports all arithematic and trignometric operators. If anyone wants to give support for other operators then he has to just make a class of that operator and tell about that object to model class and factory pattern, after performing this activity this project will be able to do calculation for that operator also.
